# StudVoice_COVID
Everyone is going through a tough time during the pandemic, where we had to align our usual lifestyle according to social distancing, and the means to slow the spread of the Corona Virus. 
As a Computer Science student in Purdue who is enrolled in in-campus classes during the fall semester, I have the natural anxiety that is the risk of large-population of Purdue getting infected. I am grateful of the precautions that Purdue has taken about the pandemic to offer a secure environment for students to learn as effectively as possible. However, the situation we are facing right now naturally derives a new experience to students, universities, and every single human being in the world. 
For this reason, I wanted to make a website about what problems does the in-campus students see during the current situation and raise awareness about the issues. The students form a very large percentage of Purdue community. If we can raise awareness about the daily-life problems that students suspect during the in-campus experience, we can take necessary precautions beforehand and avoid undesirable outcomes.
To summarize, the project allows Purdue students tell about what they see wrong in campus during the Pandemic. The aim of this project is to promote the idea of students and eliminate potential problems that will allow COVID to spread in campus, and hopefully offer more reasonable precautions.
